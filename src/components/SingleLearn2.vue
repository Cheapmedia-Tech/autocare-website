          Toyota Company has managed to stay relevant in the vehicle industry
          over the decades and they are renowned to have produced some of the
          best cars the world has ever known. However, there are different
          faults that are common to different vehicle brands and Toyota is no
          different.
          <br />
          <br />
          Hence, this article seeks to explain some faults that have been found
          with the Toyota brand of cars and what to do to effectively fix them.
          Ten of these common faults associated with Toyota cars are:
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold"
            >• Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor faults:</span
          >
          this is one of the most important engine management sensors and once
          it goes bad, it can make your car’s engine run roughly and even
          inoperable. You can detect this problem if you are experiencing poor
          performance or rough idling, jerk while driving, difficult to start
          and reduced fuel mileage.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">What to do:</span> find the MAF sensor
          between the air filter and throttle, remove the sensor and clean it
          out, then replace. To prevent a damaged MAF sensor, you need to clean
          from time to time.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">• Water pump:</span> this is an important
          composition of the engines cooling systems hence should not always be
          found faulty. However it is one of Toyota’s most reported faults. If
          you detect the following signs, that might be an indication of a bad
          water pump; engine overheating, white smoke, foul smell, rough idling,
          noise, etc.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">What to do:</span> in most bad water pump
          cases, the only way out is to replace the faulty water pump with a new
          one and ensure it is properly managed, i.e. never let your water pump
          dry out, not even for a minute.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">• Sunroof rust:</span> if you find out
          that your Toyota sunroof gets easily rusted, well it comes with the
          package as one of the common faults. This rusting is usually around
          the edges of the metal sunroofs.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">What to do:</span> for really bad sunroof,
          there will be a need to replace the entire sunroof panel. If it’s not
          so bad, rub off the rust from the surface, treat and touch up with
          some nice paint.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold"
            >• Vibration while car runs at a high speed:</span
          >
          you might have noticed that your Toyota car vibrates when it’s on a
          high speed, if not you should prepare for it. This vibration occurs at
          about 60-70mph and will be felt throughout the car. This problem is
          mostly caused by an over-tightened handbrake.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">What to do:</span> once this faulty is
          detected early enough, you can easily adjust the handbrake by
          loosening it; that will stop the vibration at high speeds. If this
          doesn’t work, consult your engineer.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">• Cold weather starts:</span> it has been
          widely reported that Toyota cars are scared of winter; no one wants to
          go out in the winter, your car is no different. Every vehicle requires
          a reasonable amount off heat for proper functioning, frost and cold
          cannot help that.
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">What to do:</span> before your Toyota
          develop this fault, its best to avoid it by properly maintaining your
          car, i.e. change the engine every three years, use the right oil,
          avoid fuel issues etc. In the advent of Cold weather starts, the first
          thing to do is put on a charge (warm up your battery). If that fails,
          get a friend to give you a jumpstart.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">• Suspension problem:</span> according to
          BBC news, Toyota is said to recall 878,000 cars to do suspension
          fault. The suspension system that works hard to give you an enjoyable
          cruise is fault if; you notice your car pull to a side while driving,
          feel every shock caused by bumps, notice a corner sits low. Other
          symptoms include your car; leaning forward when you step on the brake,
          leans to a side when to turn a bend, leans backwards when you speed
          up.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">What to do:</span> this fault will require
          a professional ‘s expertise and knowledge, so you should see your
          engineer as soon as you can, it is important not to wait until a car’s
          condition is worsen before visiting an engineer.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">• Fuel pump faults:</span> while Toyota
          appears to have one of the best engines in the market, this doesn’t
          mean it is free of some tricks that can slow down the day. Fuel pump
          problem is one of the widely reported faults of Toyota, especially
          corolla.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">What to do:</span> there is no much option
          to this, save to change the fuel pump. The good news is that changing
          a fuel pump is not so expensive. Ask your engineer.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">• Clutch plate problem:</span> your Toyota
          car is having a clutch problem if you feel the clutch pedal go soft or
          spongy. Also, difficulty in changing gears, burning smell, high RPMs,
          hesitation before acceleration, etc. are also signs of a faulty clutch
          plate.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">What to do:</span> this is quite easy to
          fix problem if it is repaired quickly. So, once you notice any of that
          stated symptoms above, please call an engineer.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">• Brake faults:</span> Other common faults
          associated with Toyota cars is brake problems. You should be worried
          if you notice; brakes screeching, vibrations and pulsation in the
          pedal or steering wheel, brake becomes harder than usual, perceive
          burning carpet when you brake etc.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">What to do:</span> when you notice this
          fault, it’s no time to tamper with the car but to immediately visit
          your mechanic.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">• Stripped engine bolts:</span> while this
          is not common to all Toyota cars, customers have bitterly complained
          about engine failure in Toyota Highlander. It is acknowledged that
          there are different factors that could have caused these failures but
          top of the chat was stripped engine bolt threads, especially in the
          2003 model.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">What to do:</span> there is nothing much
          to do about this fault other than a timely routine check-up for your
          Toyota engine. Ensure it is always in the best shape before it hits
          the road.
          <br />
          <br />
          I believe you know what to do when your Toyota car develops any of the
          faults discussed above and how to find out what is wrong with your car
          in the future. One of the ways to stay safe on the road is to ensure
          your vehicle is in a good condition.
