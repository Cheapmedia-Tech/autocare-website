        It is quite painful to have successfully purchased your dream car and
        then, fading seems to become a threat. The external part of your car is
        usually protected by layers of primer, paint, and topcoat.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the point of purchase, it looks amazing; but as you use, it begins to
        fade away because of reasons that are not far-fetched. Fading occurs
        when cars are not appropriately protected. A major determinant of fading
        is due to how cars are being washed! Fading occurs when cars are not
        washed at all, or not washed well.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your car is an important tool for mobility, hence, the need for proper
        maintenance. A proper car maintenance is very beneficial, as it enhances
        the resale price when you intend purchasing a new one. This is the need
        of our discussion: how to wash your car properly to avoid fading.
        <br />
        <br />
        No magic takes place when you do not care for your cars; as they are
        like human who need to bathed and be taken care of regularly to ensure
        they are fit enough for work. Therefore, whether you go to the car
        washes or you wash your car at home, ensuring the act of washing is done
        regularly is a basic approach to ensuring your car does not fade away
        early. Meanwhile, there is a how-to-wash which helps effectiveness.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here are step-by-step guidelines to wash your car. This would be
        sub-divided into two (2) approaches:
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="font-semibold">1. Do-It-Yourself Approach</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        The do-it-yourself approach is a great way of minimizing the expense of
        car washes. Certainly, it is not a a bad thing to do when you choose to
        wash your car yourself. It doesn’t only save money, but helps you ensure
        you do it yourself properly. It also takes away the fear of shell damage
        or faults that your car may incur at car washes. Here, are the steps and
        guidelines to do-it-yourself approach:
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="font-semibold"
          >• Always buy and use the right tools/ equipment for washing</span
        >
        <br />
        Use at least two buckets, a car shampoo, bug and tar remover; and ensure
        you use a clean microfiber towel or a chamois leather cloth in drying
        after washing. These materials are essential, as they are soft and clean
        enough not to infix a micro scratch on your car’s surface.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="font-semibold"
          >• Rinse and wash from side to side, and top to down</span
        >
        <br />
        To avoid irregular line left from smearing, it is recommended that you
        rinse and wash your car one side at a time. Also, remember not to wash
        from down to top. This is not an effective way of washing. Always wash
        from up to down; this aids washing, as well as pulling the dirt down
        easily from top to down. Ensure that the wheels are properly washed, as
        prolonged dirt on your wheel could become permanent and hard to remove
        later on.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="font-semibold">• Do not leave your car wet</span>
        Drying your car is just as important as washing it. This is the function
        of a clean and dry microfiber towel or shammies. Do not let your car dry
        out; it should be dried immediately after wash; this prevents streaks
        and spots that appear by the effect of water.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>• Wax your car</span>
        <br />
        This is not a compulsory guideline in car maintenance, however, waxing
        your car can serve as beautification (adding glamour to the colour of
        your car) and protection from damages of direct sunlight.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="font-semibold">2. Car Washes Approach</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        There a million of reasons you might not want the do-it-yourself
        approach, hence the second option is presented to you. Like we mentioned
        in the first approach, consistency matters in car maintenance. Taking
        your car regulary to local car washes is advised especially when you
        don’t have the time to do it yourself. Although, this is also determined
        by how often you use your car, whether the roads are full of dust, and
        where you park your car. Do ensure that the guidelines mentioned in the
        first approach is adhered to by whichever local car wash you choose to
        use. Also, do ensure that you check for scratch, spot, or sneak on your
        car’s surface before leaving car washes.

        <span class="font-semibold">Tips To Avoid Car Fading </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        • Avoid using brush to wash your car, soft towels are just fine.
        <br />
        <br />
        • Prevent car from receiving direct sunlight, parking in a garage is a
        great idea.
        <br />
        <br />
        • Avoid birds’ faeces dropping on your car; they are acidic and can
        damage car’s surface.
        <br />
        <br />
        • Using a car cover is another effective way of protecting your car from
        fading.
        <br />
        <br />
        • Avoid using dirty rags to clean your car, they could contain tiny
        dirts or other abrasives that are not healthy for your car.
        <br />
        <br />
        • Ensure brake dust do not stay long on your wheels.
